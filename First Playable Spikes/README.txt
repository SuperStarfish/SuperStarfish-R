Requirements:
*Android phone (preferably KitKat or higher) with an accelerometer.

Installation:
Open the .apk on your phone. Make sure you have "Allow installation of apps from unknown sources" enabled. This option can be found under "Settings" -> "Security"

How to play:
Press "Stroll" to go on a game and have a chance to encounter a random event. When this happens there will be on screen instructions. Try to keep your phone in straight lines while moving during these events. Also it needs to register a certain acceleration, so there needs to be certain speed in your movements to make them register. (This acceleration is relatively low)

Notes:
*Currently when clicking on Stroll, it does not matter whether the time left until the next stroll is on 0 or not. 
* Currently when in a stroll, you get events random, instead of an increased chance when having a certain amount of activity.
* Only one simple event is implemented.
* There are currently no rewards (in other words, feedback to the player).
* There is currently a bug: Only the first event completes fine, the next events completes multiple tasks at once (notice the sound). After hours of debugging we are still trying to understand why and how this happens and we hope that we are able to fix this soon.
* In the event: on acceleration above a certain treshold a one second input delay is inserted to prevent cheating. This will be a shorter delay, because the current delay is irritating.
